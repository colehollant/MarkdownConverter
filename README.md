# MarkdownConverter
A little guy to convert markdown to tex and html!

## Supported things
* Basic lists!
* Bolding and italicizing!
* Math mode!
* Hyperlinks!
* Code blocks! (inline coming soonish)
* indentation with `@@ `
* page break with `@@N`

## Installing
Just run `install.sh`

**NOTE** I apologize for my lack of dependency hunting. I'll get back to that later, I just wanted to toss this up first.

## TODO
* Gotta actually install dependencies
* Supporting inline code
* Supporting pictures (avoided cause I'm not sure how to do it for both tex and html)
* Supporting nested lists
